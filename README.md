# Vue Cookbook

The goal of this application is to create a functioning cookbook in vue.js.

The cookbook should be able to:

## Add and store recipes

Recipes will have a form for adding them, and the recipes will be stored in local memory.

## List existing recipes

A list of all added recipes will be available for view, ideally with filtering and sorting capabilities.

## View recipes in detail

A detailed view of each recipe will be available to the user.

Once these goals are accomplished more features will be added over time.
